 Abstract <hr>
Seeing students/passengers wasting their time, standing in longer queue for 2-3 hours, to generate their bus pass in order to travel to their educational institute or desired destination. 
Sometimes they even lost their bus pass and ticket while travelling which leads to paying fines.
So, by going through all these problems, the solution for reducing these problems and facilitate students, the "Ticket and Bus Pass Generator System" is developed.
The system makes bus e-pass within a few minutes, saving student's time and efforts. The system also provides online payment for ticket and pass fairs. 
Also, the students need not to carry any hardcopy of pass and ticket with them every time they travel which eventually eliminates the problems of losing bus pass and ticket.
